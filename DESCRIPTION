Description: Pseudocolor Density Visualization for ggplot2
    This package provides a set of custom `ggplot2` stats and a unified `geom_pseudocolor()` interface
    to visualize 2D density using pseudocolor techniques. It includes both kernel density estimation (KDE)
    and nearest-neighbor methods to compute local point densities, supporting both continuous and binned
    color mapping. These tools are designed for enhanced visual interpretation of crowded scatter plots,
    making dense regions stand out.
