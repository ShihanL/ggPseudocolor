# ggPseudocolor

ggPsueudocolor is a ggplot2 implementation of a bivariate density plot commonly used for visulising flow cytometry datasets, where scatter points are colored based on their relative densities. Base methods in ggplot2 such as geom_density_2d are unable to show individual datapoints making it harder to interpret data distributions.
